# RISC-V Assembler

This project provides an assembler for RISC-V instructions (16 bit). The assembler takes RISC-V assembly code and generates corresponding machine code. 

## Branch Predictor
Steps to setup the branch predictor :
1. Unzip the contents of `<project_root_folder>/branch_prediction/RISCV_Traces_Lab.zip` to `<project_root_folder>/branch_prediction/RISCV_Traces_Lab`.
2. Run the following shell command:
`<project_root_folder>/branch_prediction/code.exe -f <filename>.txt`
<br>The actual input file should be located at `<project_root_folder>/branch_prediction/RISCV_Traces_Lab/<filename>.txt`.
