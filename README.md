# RISC-V Assembler

This project provides an assembler for RISC-V instructions (32 bit). The assembler takes RISC-V assembly code and generates corresponding machine code. 

## Branch Predictor
Steps to setup the branch predictor :
1. Unzip the contents of `<project_root_folder>/branch_prediction/RISCV_Traces_Lab.zip` to `<project_root_folder>/branch_prediction/RISCV_Traces_Lab`.
2. Run the following shell command:
`<project_root_folder>/branch_prediction/code.exe -f <filename>.txt`
<br>The actual input file should be located at `<project_root_folder>/branch_prediction/RISCV_Traces_Lab/<filename>.txt`.

## Example
To run branch predictor on `<project_root_folder>/branch_prediction/RISCV_Traces_Lab/Fac_test_Lab.txt`,
  1. Navigate to project root folder
  2. Run shell command, `branch_prediction/code.exe -f Fac_test_Lab.txt`
